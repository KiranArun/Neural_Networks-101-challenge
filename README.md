# Neural Networks 101 challenge

This is a self-contained laboratory session of a challenge to create a model with the highest accuracy, with dataset [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).

These Python based notebooks are designed to work inside Google's free research and education tool [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com),  which requires only a Google account. Check out their [FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).

This is designed to be part of a module, directly after https://github.com/KiranArun/Neural_Networks-101-demo as a challenge against other people.

### Starter Notebook Info
- The Starter notebook already has a working [Keras](https://keras.io/) model with low performance
- It will save the best performming (highest val acc) model checkpoint to your local machine
- When doing this challenge as one of my modules, you will give me the model file, and I would test with a test dataset

### Instructions for Running:
**1. Download or clone the repository**

  - if you downloaded the ZIP, extract on your local machine
    
**2. Go to google drive, and upload this folder from your local machine**

**3. From Drive, open the notebook with Colaboratory (double-click then choose Connected apps Colaboratory)**
    
  - If Colaboratory is not shown, you'll have to first add it from Open With, then search Colab, then connect.

**4. Select runtime, change runtime type, and set hardware accelerator to GPU**

  - if it doesn't let you, that's fine (it'll just be a bit slower)
  - if are using the GPU, it may run out of memory so you'll have to use CPU

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome, I particularly appreciate corrections from PR's or raised through _Issues_. Please make an individual PR for each suggestion.

Stack Overflow would be the best place for help with using the frameworks.
