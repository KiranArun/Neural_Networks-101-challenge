# Neural Networks 101 challenge

A challenge to create a model with the highest accuracy on the [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).

This is designed to be part of a module, directly after https://github.com/KiranArun/Neural_Networks-101-demo as a challenge with other people using [google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com).

### Notebook info
- The Starter notebook already has a working model with low performance
- It will save the best performming (highest val acc) model checkpoint to your local machine
- When doing this challenge as one of my modules, you will give me the model file, and I would test with a test dataset

### Instructions for running:
1. Download or clone the repository
    - if you downloaded the ZIP, extract on your local machine
2. Go to google drive, and upload this folder from your local machine
3. From Drive, open the notebook with Colaboratory (double-click then choose Connected apps Colaboratory)
    - If Colaboratory is not shown, you'll have to first add it from Open With, then search Colab, then connect.

4. Select runtime, change runtime type, and set hardware accelerator to GPU
    - if it doesn't let you, that's fine (it'll just be a bit slower)
    - if are using the GPU on the Conv examples, the GPU may run out of memory so you'll have to use CPU
